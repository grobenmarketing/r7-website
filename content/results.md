# Case Studies
case_studies:
  - title: "The Solar Company's Appointment Cancelation Problem"
    problem: "They'd schedule 10 appointments and watch 6 or 7 evaporate. Only 8 Google reviews, no photos on their Google Business Profile, and their social media looked like a digital wasteland."
    solution: "Within weeks of bringing their digital storefront back to life - collecting reviews from satisfied customers, responding to every review like a caring business owner, adding weekly photos of sparkling solar installations and happy homeowners, plus simple social media posts showcasing their team and work."
    result: "Their appointment show-up rate soared from barely 30% to a solid 60-70%, and their sales climbed dramatically."
    testimonial:
      quote: "We were getting too many appointment cancelations. After we fixed our search presence, the growth was unbelievable."
      author: "Alan, Marketing Director"

  - title: "From Digitally Closed to Increased Revenue"
    problem: "Completely invisible online, missing major opportunities from companies searching for local vendors. Infact, the general feedback from customers before implementing the system was, 'I drove by you every day and didnt even know you were here.'"
    solution: "3 posts per week, optimize Google Business and social media profiles. Just four weeks of opening their digital doors with regular social media posts and an active Google Business Profile."
    result: "A large power company discovered them through Facebook, browsed their newly active Google Business Profile, explored their website, and handed them a massive amount of business to wrap 47 vehicles."
    testimonial:
      quote: "Everyone tells me they've seen us on social media and love it. It does seem like there's less price resistance to our quotes."
      author: "Mark, President"

  - title: "The Invisible Residential Service Business"
    problem: "Not even a flicker of life on their Google Business Profile. Phone never rang from online searches. Business was strictly word of mouth or door to door solicitation."
    solution: "Within days of installing our 'digital lighting system' - weekly posts, fresh photos, and responses to all existing reviews."
    result: "Their phone rang with a quote request. When asked how they found the business, the customer said \"from your Google profile page.\" The quotes kept coming and proposals became accepted quicker."
    testimonial:
      quote: "For the longest time the phone would ring and emails would come in like we were used to. Not too long after we did this, we started getting calls from people who found us on Google."
